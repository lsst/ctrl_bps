.. _bps-preqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

#. LSST software stack.

#. Shared filesystem for data.

#. Shared database.

   `SQLite3`_ is fine for small runs like **ci_hsc_gen3** if have POSIX
   filesystem.  For larger runs, use `PostgreSQL`_.

#. A workflow management service.

   Currently, two workflow management services are supported HTCondor's
   `DAGMan`_ and `Pegasus WMS`_.  Both of them requires an HTCondor cluster.
   NCSA hosts a few of such clusters, see `this`_ page for details.

#. HTCondor's Python `bindings`_ (if using `HTCondor`_) or `Pegasus WMS`_.

.. _bps-installation:

Installing Batch Processing Service
-----------------------------------

Starting from LSST Stack version ``w_2020_45``, the package providing Batch
Processing Service, `ctrl_bps`_, comes with ``lsst_distrib``.  However, if
you'd like to  try out its latest features, you may install a bleeding edge
version similarly to any other LSST package:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lsst-dm/ctrl_bps
   cd ctrl_bps
   setup -k -r .
   scons

.. _bps-data-repository:


.. _ctrl_bps: https://github.com/lsst/ctrl_bps

Creating Butler repository
--------------------------

You’ll need a pre-existing Butler dataset repository containing all the input
files needed for your run.  This repository needs to be on the filesystem
shared among all compute resources (e.g. submit and compute nodes) you use
during your run.

.. note::

   Keep in mind though, that you don't need to bootstrap a dataset repository
   for every BPS run.  You only need to do it when Gen3 data definition
   language (DDL) changes, you want to to start a repository from scratch, and
   possibly if want to add/change inputs in repo (depending on the inputs and
   flexibility of the bootstrap scripts).

For testing purposes, you can use `pipelines_check`_ package to set up your own
Butler dataset repository.  To make that repository, follow the usual steps
when installing an LSST package:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lsst/pipelines_check
   cd pipelines_check
   git checkout w_2020_45  # checkout the branch matching the software branch you are using
   setup -k -r .
   scons

.. _pipelines_check: https://github.com/lsst/pipelines_check

.. _bps-submission:

Defining a submission
---------------------

BPS configuration files are YAML files with some reserved keywords and some
special features.  They are meant to be syntactically flexible to allow users
figure out what works best for them.  The syntax and features of a BPS
configuration file are described in greater detail in
:ref:`bps-configuration-file`.  Below is just a minimal example to keep you
going.

There are groups of information needed to define a submission to the Batch
Production Service.  They include the pipeline definition, the payload
(information about the data in the run), submission and runtime configuration.

Describe a pipeline to BPS by telling it where to find either the pipeline YAML
file (recommended)

.. code-block:: YAML

   pipelineYaml: "${OBS_SUBARU_DIR}/pipelines/DRP.yaml#processCcd"

or a pre-made file containing a serialized QuantumGraph, for example

.. code-block:: YAML

   qgraphFile: pipelines_check_w_2020_45.qgraph

.. warning::

   The file with a serialized QuantumGraph is not portable. The file must be
   crated by the same stack being used when running BPS *and* it can be only
   used on the machine with the same environment.

The payload information should be familiar too as it is mostly the information
normally used on the pipetask command line (input collections, output
collections, etc).

The remaining information tells BPS which workflow management system is being
used, how to convert Datasets and Pipetasks into compute jobs and what
resources those compute jobs need.

.. literalinclude:: pipelines_check.yaml
   :language: YAML
   :caption: ${CTRL_BPS_DIR}/doc/lsst.ctrl.bps/pipelines_check.yaml

.. _bps-submit:

Submitting a run
----------------

Submit a run for execution with

.. code-block:: bash

   bps submit example.yaml

If submission was successfully, it will output something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   Submit dir: /home/jdoe/tmp/bps/submit/shared/pipecheck/20201111T13h34m08s
   Run Id: 176261

Adding ``--log-level INFO`` option to the command line outputs more information
especially for those wanting to watch how long the various submission stages
take. 

.. _bps-report:

Checking status
---------------

To check the status of the submitted run, you can use tools provided by
HTCondor or Pegasus, for example, ``condor_status`` or ``pegasus-status``. To
get a more pipeline oriented information use

.. code-block:: bash

   bps report

which should display run summary similar to the one below ::

	X      STATE  %S       ID OPERATOR   PRJ   CMPGN    PAYLOAD    RUN
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	     RUNNING   0   176270 jdoe       dev   quick    pcheck     shared_pipecheck_20201111T14h59m26s

To see results regarding past submissions, use ``bps report --hist X``  where
``X`` is the number of days past day to look at (can be a fraction).  For
example ::

	$ bps report --hist 1
		STATE  %S       ID OPERATOR   PRJ   CMPGN    PAYLOAD    RUN
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	   FAILED   0   176263 jdoe       dev   quick    pcheck     shared_pipecheck_20201111T13h51m59s
	SUCCEEDED 100   176265 jdoe       dev   quick    pcheck     shared_pipecheck_20201111T13h59m26s

Use ``bps report --help`` to see all currently supported options.

.. _bps-terminate:

Canceling submitted jobs
--------------------------

The bps command to cancel bps-submitted jobs is

.. code-block:: bash

   bps cancel --id <id>

or to cancel all of your runs use

.. code-block:: bash

   bps cancel --user <username>

For example ::

        $ bps submit pipelines_check.yaml
        Submit dir: /scratch/mgower/submit/u/mgower/pipelines_check/20210414T190212Z
        Run Id: 369

        $ bps report
        X      STATE  %S        ID OPERATOR   PRJ        CMPGN                PAYLOAD              RUN
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
             RUNNING   0       369 mgower     dev        quick                pcheck               u_mgower_pipelines_check_20210414T190212Z

        $ bps cancel --id 369
        Successfully canceled: 369.0

        $ bps report
        X      STATE  %S        ID OPERATOR   PRJ        CMPGN                PAYLOAD              RUN
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   Sometimes there may be a small delay between executing cancel and jobs
   disappearing from the WMS queue.  Under normal conditions this delay
   is less than a minute.

This command tries to prevent someone using it to cancel non-bps jobs.  It can
be forced to skip this check by including the option ``--skip-require-bps``.
Use this at your own risk.

If ``bps cancel`` says "0 jobs found matching arguments", first double check the
id for typos.  If you believe there is a problem with the "is it a bps job"
check, add ``--skip-require-bps``.

If jobs are hanging around in the queue with an X status in condor_q, you can
add the following to force delete those jobs from the queue ::

        --pass-thru "-forcex"

If ``bps cancel`` fails to delete the jobs, you can use direct WMS executables
like `condor_rm`__ or `pegasus-remove`__. 

.. note::

   Using the WMS commands directly under normal circumstances is not
   advised as bps may someday include additional code.

Both take the ``runId`` printed by ``bps submit``.  For example

.. code-block:: bash

   condor_rm 176270       # HTCondor
   pegasus-remove 176270  # Pegasus WMS

``bps report`` also prints the ``runId`` usable by ``condor_rm``.  

If you want to just clobber all of the runs that you have currently submitted,
you can just do the following no matter if using HTCondor or Pegasus WMS plugin:

.. code-block:: bash

   condor_rm <username>

.. __: https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man-pages/condor_rm.html
.. __: https://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation/cli-pegasus-remove.php

.. _bps-configuration-file:

BPS configuration file
----------------------

The configuration file is in YAML format.  One particular YAML
syntax to be mindful about is that boolean values must be all
lowercase.

Configuration file can include other configuration files using
``includeConfigs`` with YAML array syntax. For example

.. code-block:: YAML

   includeConfigs:
     - bps-operator.yaml
     - bps-site-htcondor.yaml

Values in the configuration file can be defined in terms of other values using
``{key}`` syntax, for example

.. code-block:: YAML

   patch: 69
   dataQuery: patch = {patch}

Environment variables can be used as well with ``${var}`` syntax, for example

.. code-block:: YAML

   submitRoot: ${PWD}/submit
   runQuantumExec: ${CTRL_MPEXEC_DIR}/bin/pipetask

.. note::

   Note the difference, ``$`` (dollar sign), when using an environmental
   variable, e.g. ``${foo}``, and plain config variable ``{foo}``.

Section names can be used to store default settings at that concept level which
can be overridden by settings at more specific concept levels.  Currently the
order from most specific to general is: ``payload``, ``pipetask``, and ``site``.

**payload**
    description of the submission including definition of inputs

**pipetask**
    subsections are pipetask labels where can override/set runtime settings for
    particular pipetasks (currently no Quantum-specific settings).

**site**
    settings for specific sites can be set here.  Subsections are site names
    which are matched to ``computeSite``.  The following are examples for
    specifying values needed to match jobs to glideins.

    HTCondor plugin example:

    .. code-block:: YAML

       site:
         acsws02:
           profile:
             condor:
               requirements: "(GLIDEIN_NAME == &quot;test_gname&quot;)"
               +GLIDEIN_NAME: "test_gname"

    Pegasus plugin example:

    .. code-block:: YAML

       site:
         acsws02:
           arch: x86_64
           os: LINUX
           directory:
             shared-scratch:
               path: /work/shared-scratch/${USER}
               file-server:
                 operation: all
                 url: file:///work/shared-scratch/${USER}
           profile:
             pegasus:
               style: condor
               auxillary.local: true
             condor:
               universe: vanilla
               getenv: true
               requirements: '(ALLOCATED_NODE_SET == &quot;${NODESET}&quot;)'
               +JOB_NODE_SET: '&quot;${NODESET}&quot;'
             dagman:
               retry: 0
             env:
               PEGASUS_HOME: /usr/local/pegasus/current

Supported settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**butlerConfig**
    Location of the Butler configuration file needed by BPS to create run
    collection entry in Butler dataset repository

**campaign**
    A label used to group submissions together.  May be used for
    grouping submissions for particular deliverable (e.g., a JIRA issue number,
    a milestone, etc.). Can be used as variable in output collection name.
    Displayed in ``bps report`` output.

**clusterAlgorithm**
    Algorithm to use to group Quanta into single Python executions that can
    share in-memory datastore.  Currently, just uses single quanta executions,
    but this is here for future growth.

**computeSite**
    Specification of the compute site where to run the workflow and which site
    settings to use in ``bps prepare``).

**createQuantumGraph**
    The command line specification for generating QuantumGraphs.

**operator**
    Name of the Operator who made a submission.  Displayed in ``bps report``
    output.  Defaults to the Operator's username.

**pipelineYaml**
    Location of the YAML file describing the science pipeline.

**project**
    Another label for groups of submissions.  May be used to differentiate
    between test submissions from production submissions.  Can be used as a
    variable in the output collection name.  Displayed in ``bps report``
    output.

**requestMemory**, optional
    Amount of memory, in MB, a single Quantum execution of a particular pipetask
    will need (e.g., 2048).

**requestCpus**, optional
    Number of cpus that a single Quantum execution of a particular pipetask
    will need (e.g., 1).

**uniqProcName**
    Used when giving names to graphs, default names to output files, etc.  If
    not specified by user, BPS tries to use ``outCollection`` with '/' replaced
    with '_'.

**submitPath**
    Directory where the output files of ``bps prepare`` go.

**runQuantumCommand**
    The command line specification for running a Quantum. Must start with
    executable name (a full path if using HTCondor plugin) followed by options
    and arguments.  May contain other variables defined in the configuration
    file.

**runInit**
    Whether to add a ``pipetask --init-only`` to the workflow or not. If true,
    expects there to be a **pipetask** section called **pipetaskInit** which
    contains the ``runQuantumCommand`` for the ``pipetask --init-only``. For
    example

    .. code-block:: YAML

       payload:
         runInit: true

       pipetask:
         pipetask_init:
           runQuantumCommand: "${CTRL_MPEXEC_DIR}/bin/pipetask --long-log run -b {butlerConfig} -i {inCollection} --output {output} --output-run {outCollection} --init-only --register-dataset-types --qgraph {qgraphFile} --clobber-partial-outputs --no-versions"
           requestMemory: 2048

    The above example command uses both ``--output`` and ``--output-run``.  The ``--output`` option creates the chained collection if necessary and defines it to include both the ``--input`` and ``--output-run`` collections.  The ``--output-run`` option saves the unique run collection that is also passed to all other compute jobs (i.e., one run collection per submission).  If using both here, must include both ``--output`` and ``--output-run`` in the other ``runQuantumCommand``.

**templateDataId**
    Template to use when creating job names (and HTCondor plugin then uses for
    job output filenames).

**wmsServiceClass**
    Workload Management Service plugin to use. For example

    .. code-block:: YAML

       wmsServiceClass: lsst.ctrl.bps.wms.htcondor.htcondor_service.HTCondorService  # HTCondor

**bpsUseShared**
    Whether to put full submit-time path to QuantumGraph file in command line
    because the WMS plugin requires shared filesystem.  Defaults to False.
    HTCondor and Pegasus plugins do not need this value.

**whenSaveJobQgraph**
    When to output job QuantumGraph files (default = TRANSFORM).

    * NEVER = all jobs will use full QuantumGraph file. (Warning: make sure
      runQuantumCommand has ``--qgraph-id {qgraphId} --qgraph-node-id {qgraphNodeId}``.)
    * TRANSFORM = Output QuantumGraph files after creating GenericWorkflow.
    * PREPARE = QuantumGraph files are output after creating WMS submission.

**saveClusteredQgraph**
    A boolean flag.  If set, BPS will save serialized clustered quantum
    graph to a file called ``bps_clustered_qgraph.pickle`` using
    Python's `pickle`_ module.  The file will be located  the submit
    directory.  By default, it is set to false.

    Setting it to true will significantly increase memory requirements
    when submitting large workflows as `pickle`_ constructs a complete
    copy of the object in memory before it writes it to disk. [`ref`_]

**saveGenericWorkflow**
    A boolean flag.  If set BPS will save serialized generic workflow
    called to a file called ``bps_generic_workflow.pickle`` using
    Python's `pickle`_ module. The file will be located in the submit
    directory.  By default, it is set to false.

**saveDot**
    A boolean flag.  If set, BPS will generate graphical representations
    of both the clustered quantum graph and the generic workflow in DOT
    format.  The files will be located in the submit directory and their
    names will be ``bps_clustered_qgraph.dot`` and
    ``bps_generic_workflow.dot``, respectively.  By default, it is set
    to false.

    It is recommended to use this option only when working with small
    graphs/workflows.  The plots will be practically illegible for graphs which
    number of nodes exceeds order of tens.

.. _ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/38971446

Reserved keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**gqraphFile**
    Name of the file with a pre-made, serialized QuantumGraph.

    Such a file is an alternative way to describe a science pipeline.
    However, contrary to YAML specification, it is currently not portable.

**qgraphId**
    Internal ID for the full QuantumGraph (passed as ``--qgraph-id`` on pipetask command line).

**qgraphNodeId**
    Comma-separated list of internal QuantumGraph node numbers to be
    executed from the full QuantumGraph (passed as ``--qgraph-node-id`` on pipetask
    command line).

**timestamp**
    Created automatically by BPS at submit time that can be used in the user
    specification of other values (e.g., in output collection names so that one
    can repeatedly submit the same BPS configuration without changing anything)

.. note::

   Any values shown in the example configuration file, but not covered in this
   section are examples of user-defined variables (e.g. ``inCollection``) and
   are not required by BPS.

.. _job-qgraph-files:

QuantumGraph Files
------------------

BPS can be configured to either create per-job QuantumGraph files or use the
single full QuantumGraph file plus node numbers for each job. The default is
using per-job QuantumGraph files.

To use full QuantumGraph file, the submit YAML must set `whenSaveJobQgraph` to
"NEVER" and the ``pipetask run`` command must include ``--qgraph-id {qgraphId}
--qgraph-node-id {qgraphNodeId}``.  For example:

.. code::

    whenSaveJobQgraph: "NEVER"
    runQuantumCommand: "${CTRL_MPEXEC_DIR}/bin/pipetask --long-log run -b {butlerConfig} -i {inCollection} --output {output} --output-run {outCollection} --extend-run --skip-init-writes --qgraph {qgraphFile} --qgraph-id {qgraphId} --qgraph-node-id {qgraphNodeId} --clobber-partial-outputs --no-versions"

-- warning::

   Do not modify the QuantumGraph options in pipetaskInit's runQuantumCommand.  It needs the entire QuantumGraph.

-- note::

   If running on a system with a shared filesystem, you'll more than likely want to also set bpsUseShared
   to true.

.. _bps-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
---------------

Where is stdout/stderr from pipeline tasks?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For now, stdout/stderr can be found in files in the submit run directory.

HTCondor
""""""""

The names are of the format:

.. code-block:: bash

   <run submit dir>/jobs/<task label>/<quantum graph nodeNumber>_<task label>_<templateDataId>[.<htcondor job id>.[sub|out|err|log]

Pegasus WMS
"""""""""""

Pegasus does its own directory structure and wrapping of ``pipetask`` output.

You can dig around in the submit run directory here too, but try
`pegasus-analyzer`__ command first.

.. __: https://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation/cli-pegasus-analyzer.php

Advanced debugging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are some advanced debugging tips:

#. If ``bps submit`` is taking a long time, probably it is spending the time
   during QuantumGraph generation.  The QuantumGraph generation command line
   and output will be in ``quantumGraphGeneration.out`` in the submit run
   directory, e.g.
   ``submit/shared/pipecheck/20200806T00h22m26s/quantumGraphGeneration.out``.

#. Check the ``*.dag.dagman.out`` for errors (in particular for ``ERROR: submit
   attempt failed``).

#. The Pegasus ``runId`` is the submit subdirectory where the underlying DAG
   lives.  If you’ve forgotten the Pegasus ``runId`` needed to use in the
   Pegasus commands try one of the following:

   #. It’s the submit directory in which the ``braindump.txt`` file lives.  If
      you know the submit root directory, use find to give you a list of
      directories to try.  (Note that many of these directories could be for
      old runs that are no longer running.)o

      .. code-block:: bash

         find submit  -name "braindump.txt"

   #. Use HTCondor commands to find submit directories for running jobs

      .. code-block:: bash

         condor_q -constraint 'pegasus_wf_xformation == "pegasus::dagman"' -l | grep Iwd
