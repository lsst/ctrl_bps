    Parameters
    ----------
    wms_service : `str` or `lsst.ctrl.bps.BaseWmsService`
        Name of the Workload Management System service class.
    wms_id : `str`, optional
        ID or path of job that should be canceled.
    user : `str`, optional
        User whose submitted jobs should be canceled.
    require_bps : `bool`, optional
        Whether to require given run_id/user to be a bps submitted job.
    pass_thru : `str`, optional
        Information to pass through to WMS.
    is_global : `bool`, optional
        If set, all available job queues will be checked for jobs to cancel.
        Defaults to False which means that only a local job queue will be
        checked.

        Only applicable in the context of a WMS using distributed job queues
        (e.g., HTCondor).
